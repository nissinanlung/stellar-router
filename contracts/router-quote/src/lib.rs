#![no_std]

//! # router-quote
//!
//! Preview transaction results before execution. Supports single-hop and
//! multi-hop quotes where the output of one pool feeds into the next.
//!
//! ## Multi-hop routing
//!
//! A multi-hop quote chains N liquidity plugin calls:
//!
//!   token_A → [plugin_1] → token_B → [plugin_2] → token_C
//!
//! Each plugin must implement `get_quote(token_in, token_out, amount_in) -> i128`.
//! The `amount_out` of hop N becomes the `amount_in` of hop N+1.
//! Fees and slippage are applied at each hop independently.
//!
//! ## Exchange rate
//!
//! Exchange rates are fixed-point integers with configurable decimal precision:
//!
//!   exchange_rate = (amount_out * 10^precision) / amount_in
//!
//! A rate of `2_000_000` with `precision = 6` means 2.000000 token_out per token_in.
//! Preview transaction results before execution.
//! Returns expected output amount, fees, exchange rate, and route details
//! without executing the transaction.
//!
//! ## Exchange Rate
//!
//! Exchange rates are calculated as a fixed-point integer with configurable
//! decimal precision. For example, with `precision = 6`:
//!
//!   exchange_rate = (amount_out * 10^precision) / amount_in
//!
//! A rate of `1_050_000` with precision 6 means 1.050000 token_out per token_in.
//! This avoids floating point entirely and is safe for on-chain use.

extern crate alloc;
use alloc::string::ToString;
//! Allows users to get quote information including expected output amount,
//! fees, and route details without executing the transaction.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Get quote from any registered liquidity plugin
//! - Returns expected output amount, fees, and route details
//! - Caller-specified slippage tolerance via `slippage_bps` parameter
//! - Quote expiration via configurable TTL (`set_quote_ttl` / `get_quote_ttl`)
//! - Does not execute transactions (read-only preview)
//! - Works with any plugin implementing the get_quote interface
//!
//! ## Events
//! - `fee_estimated` — emitted on each `estimate_fee` call (total_fee, surge_pricing)
//! ## Events (following naming convention: past tense verbs in snake_case)
//! - `quote_requested` — Quote request logged (route_name, token_in, token_out, amount_in)
